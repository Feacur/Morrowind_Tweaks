# Summary
My personal tweaks for TES3: Morrowind.  
Partially based on "Patch for Purists", "Expansion Delay", "TLAD: Necro".  

Be aware:
- I'm running French version of the game
- localization is embeded into `*.esp`s and `*.esm`s by Bethesda's design (automatic conversion can be partially done using [YAMPT](https://github.com/raffll/yampt) with the [dictionaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44518/))
- the modification is basically a playground for me, and being done iteratively; thus better to rely on PfP et al

Why creating this instead of using the ready-made ones?
- actually I do use some; but there are others which are risky to enable in the middle of the game
- it's fun to rewrite, tune, and create scripts (in sync with the relevant objects, topics, journal entries)
- I'm quite ok with the vanilla game - just want a tad fewer bugs and more immersive experience
  - for instance, I fixed/restored Nibani Maesa's wait-one-day mechanic (the topic and response is already there in the original `*.esm`, localized)
